# Go Humble! RSS

A curated RSS Feed of HumbleBundle bundles, generated using Go. 🐭

## About

Hello, this is my first repo in Github and I am very new. I created this, because I want to use a Discord Bot that will use .rss to post the newest Humble Bundles to my Discord. The original code ist from "https://github.com/shimst3r/go-humble" sadly his site is not working anymore. Thats why I created my own to use the .rss site.
