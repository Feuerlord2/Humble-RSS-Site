# Go Humble! RSS

A curated RSS Feed of HumbleBundle bundles, generated using Go.

## About

I wanted a RSS Bot for my Discord that posts the newest Humble Bundles. Then I cam across the website of https://github.com/shimst3r/go-humble and I tried it out. But his website wasn't showing the newest bundles anymore. I copied it so I can use the GitHub Pages function to create my own RSS Feed.
