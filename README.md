## About

Go Humble! RSS is available on my personal homepage via [shimst3r.xyz/go-humble](https://shimst3r.xyz/go-humble/). It is [a Go script](cmd/gohumble.go) that parses data from [HumbleBundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) for each bundle (books, games, and software) and generates a RSS feed per bundle.

To keep the feed up to date, I am using [a schedule GitHub Action](.github/workflows/update_rss.yml) that updates each feed once per day.
