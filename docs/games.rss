      <title>Awesome Games Done Quick 2026</title>
      <link>https://humblebundle.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick-2026</link>
      <description>Gotta go fast</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re kicking off the new year right by partnering with Games Done Quick for their Awesome Games Done Quick fundraiser starting on January 4! If you want to test your skills against the expert speedrunners competing in the event, we’ve got all 10 games in one bundle! Inside you’ll find great games you can either zoom through or play at your own pace, like <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>, a cozy game about a little witch who delivers packages to the residents of her small town. Or snag the <em>Shovel Knight</em> DLC <em>Shovel Knight: King of Cards</em> and help King Knight fight off enemies and win the ultimate card game. If horror games are more your speed (no pun intended), check out <em>F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</em> and escape the clutches of an experimental organization and a paranormal menace. Like Games Done Quick, we’re donating a portion of every bundle purchase to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. ]]></content:encoded>
